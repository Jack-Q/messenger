### P2P over NAT
* Consider to implement some naive handling for NAT problem
* Reference: [P2P NAT](http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/net/p2pnat/)
* Implementation consideration
  * Check and see if we can just connect (The user did manual port forwarding)
  * Use UPnP and open a port
  * Use some form of hole punching using a public server as the go between
  * Use another peer that does have ports open as a proxy for the data (a Supernode).
  * Use a server I host as a proxy to forward the data.
